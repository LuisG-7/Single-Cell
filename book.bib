abstract = {The advent of single-cell sequencing started a new era of transcriptomic and genomic research, advancing our knowledge of the cellular heterogeneity and dynamics. Cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data, yet manual annotation is time-consuming and partially subjective. As an alternative, tools have been developed for automatic cell type identification. Different strategies have emerged to ultimately associate gene expression profiles of single cells with a cell type either by using curated marker gene databases, correlating reference expression data, or transferring labels by supervised classification. In this review, we present an overview of the available tools and the underlying approaches to perform automated cell type annotations on scRNA-seq data.}

abstract={Cell--cell interactions orchestrate organismal development, homeostasis and single-cell functions. When cells do not properly interact or improperly decode molecular messages, disease ensues. Thus, the identification and quantification of intercellular signalling pathways has become a common analysis performed across diverse disciplines. The expansion of protein--protein interaction databases and recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies have enabled routine analyses of intercellular signalling from gene expression measurements of bulk and single-cell data sets. In particular, ligand--receptor pairs can be used to infer intercellular communication from the coordinated expression of their cognate genes. In this Review, we highlight discoveries enabled by analyses of cell--cell interactions from transcriptomic data and review the methods and tools used in this context.},

abstract={Understanding global communications among cells requires accurate representation of cell-cell signaling links and effective systems-level analyses of those links. We construct a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. We then develop CellChat, a tool that is able to quantitatively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer (http://www.cellchat.org/) will help discover novel intercellular communications and build cell-cell communication atlases in diverse tissues.},

abstract={Trajectory inference approaches analyze genome-wide omics data from thousands of single cells and computationally infer the order of these cells along developmental trajectories. Although more than 70 trajectory inference tools have already been developed, it is challenging to compare their performance because the input they require and output models they produce vary substantially. Here, we benchmark 45 of these methods on 110 real and 229 synthetic datasets for cellular ordering, topology, scalability and usability. Our results highlight the complementarity of existing tools, and that the choice of method should depend mostly on the dataset dimensions and trajectory topology. Based on these results, we develop a set of guidelines to help users select the best method for their dataset. Our freely available data and evaluation pipeline (https://benchmark.dynverse.org) will aid in the development of improved tools designed to analyze increasingly large and complex single-cell datasets.},

    abstract = "{Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, a powerful tool for analyzing the entire transcriptome at single cell level, is receiving increasing research attention. The presence of dropouts is an important characteristic of scRNA-seq data that may affect the performance of downstream analyses, such as dimensionality reduction and clustering. Cells sequenced to lower depths tend to have more dropouts than those sequenced to greater depths. In this study, we aimed to develop a dimensionality reduction method to address both dropouts and the non-negativity constraints in scRNA-seq data. The developed method simultaneously performs dimensionality reduction and dropout imputation under the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) framework. The dropouts were modeled as a non-negative sparse matrix. Summation of the observed data matrix and dropout matrix was approximated by NMF. To ensure the sparsity pattern was maintained, a weighted ℓ1 penalty that took into account the dependency of dropouts on the sequencing depth in each cell was imposed. An efficient algorithm was developed to solve the proposed optimization problem. Experiments using both synthetic data and real data showed that dimensionality reduction via the proposed method afforded more robust clustering results compared with those obtained from the existing methods, and that dropout imputation improved the differential expression analysis.}",

abstract={Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies allow researchers to uncover the biological states of a single cell at high resolution. For computational efficiency and easy visualization, dimensionality reduction is necessary to capture gene expression patterns in low-dimensional space. Here we propose an ensemble method for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and feature gene extraction (EDGE) of scRNA-seq data. Different from existing dimensionality reduction techniques, the proposed method implements an ensemble learning scheme that utilizes massive weak learners for an accurate similarity search. Based on the similarity matrix constructed by those weak learners, the low-dimensional embedding of the data is estimated and optimized through spectral embedding and stochastic gradient descent. Comprehensive simulation and empirical studies show that EDGE is well suited for searching for meaningful organization of cells, detecting rare cell types, and identifying essential feature genes associated with certain cell types.},

abstract = {Abstract Single-cell RNA-seq has enabled gene expression to be studied at an unprecedented resolution. The promise of this technology is attracting a growing user base for single-cell analysis methods. As more analysis tools are becoming available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate this landscape and produce an up-to-date workflow to analyse one's data. Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice. Our documented case study can be found at https://www.github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial. This review will serve as a workflow tutorial for new entrants into the field, and help established users update their analysis pipelines.},

abstract={Breakthroughs in the development of high-throughput technologies for profiling transcriptomes at the single-cell level have helped biologists to understand the heterogeneity of cell populations, disease states and developmental lineages. However, these single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies generate an extraordinary amount of data, which creates analysis and interpretation challenges. Additionally, scRNA-seq datasets often contain technical sources of noise owing to incomplete RNA capture, PCR amplification biases and/or batch effects specific to the patient or sample. If not addressed, this technical noise can bias the analysis and interpretation of the data. In response to these challenges, a suite of computational tools has been developed to process, analyse and visualize scRNA-seq datasets. Although the specific steps of any given scRNA-seq analysis might differ depending on the biological questions being asked, a core workflow is used in most analyses. Typically, raw sequencing reads are processed into a gene expression matrix that is then normalized and scaled to remove technical noise. Next, cells are grouped according to similarities in their patterns of gene expression, which can be summarized in two or three dimensions for visualization on a scatterplot. These data can then be further analysed to provide an in-depth view of the cell types or developmental trajectories in the sample of interest.},
